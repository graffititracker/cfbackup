CFBackup
---------------------------------
CFBackup is a small ruby program that transfers files or directories
from the local machine to a Cloud Files container. It is meant to serve
as a useful tool for automated backups.

---------------------------------
A Warning
---------------------------------
CFBackup has limited behavior patterns. For example, it will not warn 
you if an existing file will be overwritten. It will blindly do as it's
told.

---------------------------------
Requirements
---------------------------------
You will need a working Ruby >= 1.8 environment. You will also need several
supporting libraries:
	libopenssl libxml2 libxslt

The following gems are also required:

	mime-types archive-tar-minitar nokogiri hoe rcov

If you are using Ubuntu Intrepid, the following commands should bring
your machine up to par:

sudo aptitude install ruby ruby-dev rubygems irb libopenssl-ruby libxml2-dev libxslt-ruby libxslt-dev
sudo gem install mime-types archive-tar-minitar nokogiri hoe rcov	

---------------------------------
Examples
---------------------------------
Backing up a local temp directory to a container named "backups"

	ruby cfconfig.rb --local_path temp/ --container backup
	
Backing up a directory using the local network (applies only to 
Slicehost or Moss Cloud Server customers)
	
		ruby cfbackup.rb --local_path temp/ --container backup --local_net
